Banks thrive when they lend smart — not just fast. Yet traditional credit assessment methods often rely on limited metrics like income or collateral, missing deeper behavioral and demographic patterns that actually determine repayment ability. The result? High default rates that drain profits and missed opportunities from rejecting good borrowers.

This project tackles that business challenge by developing a machine learning–powered credit scoring model that predicts the likelihood of loan default using customer demographic, financial, and historical repayment data.

The goal is simple but powerful:

Maximize revenue by approving more creditworthy customers.

Minimize losses by flagging high-risk borrowers early.

Automate decision-making to boost operational efficiency.

Enable data-driven lending strategies aligned with profitability and compliance.

Under the hood, the model applies end-to-end data science — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training, validation, and performance evaluation — delivering a scalable, evidence-based approach to credit risk management.
Ultimately, this project demonstrates how data science can transform lending into a predictive, revenue-optimized process that strengthens financial stability and customer trust.
